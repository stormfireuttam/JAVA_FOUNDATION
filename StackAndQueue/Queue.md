# Queue

- Queue implements **FIFO**
- Queue is a **Linear** Data Structure
- In Queue addition takes place at **rear** end and this operation is called **enqueue**. In Java to enqueue an element to Queue we use the **add()** function.
- In Queue deletion takes place at **front** end and this operation is called **dequeue**. In Java to dequeue an element from Queue we use the **remove()** function.
- Other than this Java also offers the functionality of **peek()** function which returns the element at the front end.
- In Java Queue is an interface, so to create an object of Queue we make use of ArrayDequeue class which implements Dequeue whereas Dequeue extends the Queue interface
  
  **Queue<T> q = new ArrayDequeue<T>();**
